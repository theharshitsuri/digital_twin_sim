# Digital Twin Simulation of BSCS Curriculum

This project simulates student progression through a Computer Science curriculum using **agent-based modeling (ABM)** with Mesa.  
It aims to create *digital twins* of students that can be used for analyzing retention, dropout, and graduation rates under different conditions.

## Features
- Synthetic student dataset generation
- Course catalog & schedule integration (from USF OASIS Excel)
- Agent-based simulation with students as agents
- Tracking of GPA, prereqs, course enrollments, and outcomes
- Dashboards with Streamlit for visualization
